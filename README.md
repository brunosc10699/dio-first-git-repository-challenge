DIO ([Digital Innovation One](https://web.digitalinnovation.one)) is the largest free technology learning platform of all time. There we have free courses, bootcamps, labs, live coding, articles and accelerations to give you all the knowledge you need to start a new career or improve yourself. You can subscribe to it by typing https://web.digitalinnovation.one into your browser. 

This repository was created to list all the courses I take on the DIO platform. 

Thank you very much DIO!
